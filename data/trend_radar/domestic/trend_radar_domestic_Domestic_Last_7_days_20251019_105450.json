      "final_report": "## A. Directions\n\n### 1. **General AI Brain for Robotic Adaptability**\n\nThe development of a general AI brain that enables robots to adapt to physical damage or changes in their environment represents a major breakthrough in robotic intelligence. This concept, introduced by Skild AI, allows robots to maintain functionality even after experiencing significant mechanical failures, such as losing limbs or suffering from motor damage. The implications are profound, as it could lead to more resilient and self-sufficient robotic systems capable of operating in unpredictable real-world environments without human intervention.\n\n**Representative projects**:\n- **Skild Brain**: This framework introduces a \"brain\" that is independent of the robot's physical body, enabling it to adapt to various scenarios. It uses dynamic learning and self-adjustment mechanisms to ensure continued operation after damage.\n- **Physical Intelligence π0.5 Model**: Developed by UC Berkeley, this model demonstrates how robots can perform tasks in unstructured environments, such as cleaning a kitchen, using self-evolving strategies to handle new challenges.\n- **R-Stitch Framework**: Proposed by Monash, Beihang, and Zhejiang University, this approach combines small and large language models to improve inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**References** 🔗:\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-14-9\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-12\n- https://hub.baai.ac.cn/view/49601\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-17-13\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-16-10\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-14\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-14-12\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-13-8\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-16-7\n\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Dynamic Model Collaboration for Enhanced Inference Speed**\n\nEfforts to enhance the inference speed of large language models (LLMs) through dynamic collaboration between small and large models represent a critical direction in AI optimization. This approach, exemplified by the R-Stitch framework, leverages the strengths of both model sizes to achieve faster processing times without sacrificing accuracy. By intelligently assigning tasks based on risk assessment, this method offers a scalable solution for improving the efficiency of AI systems in real-time applications.\n\n**Representative projects**:\n- **R-Stitch Framework**: This dynamic model collaboration technique uses risk assessment to determine whether to use a small model for simple tasks or a large model for complex ones, significantly reducing inference time while maintaining high accuracy.\n- **GRPO and GVPO Methods**: These reinforcement learning techniques aim to stabilize training processes and reduce computational costs, with GVPO offering improved performance over GRPO in post-training scenarios.\n- **Self-Forcing++**: This method enhances video generation capabilities by allowing models to generate longer, high-quality videos without retraining on long-video data, pushing the boundaries of diffusion-based models.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**References** 🔗:\n- https://hub.baai.ac.cn/view/49586\n\n\n---\n\n### 3. **AGI Definition and Measurement**\n\nThe quantification of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has become a pivotal area of research, led by Yoshua Bengio and other leading researchers. This trend involves defining AGI in measurable terms, such as cognitive versatility and depth, to establish a benchmark for evaluating AI systems. As AGI becomes a key focus for tech giants, defining its parameters will be crucial for guiding future AI development and ensuring ethical deployment.\n\n**Representative projects**:\n- **A Definition of AGI**: This paper, co-authored by Yoshua Bengio and others, provides a quantifiable definition of AGI, emphasizing its ability to match or exceed human cognitive abilities in multifaceted tasks.\n- **SafeEvalAgent**: Developed by Fudan University and Shanghai AI Lab, this framework evaluates the safety and compliance of large language models against global regulations, revealing differences in international compliance standards.\n- **AGI Progress Tracking**: Researchers at OpenAI and other institutions are actively working on measuring AGI progress, with GPT-5 achieving only about 58% of the defined AGI benchmarks.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**References** 🔗:\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-17-11\n- https://www.qbitai.com/2025/10/342761.html\n\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Efficient and Scalable Diffusion Language Models**\n\nThe emergence of efficient and scalable diffusion language models (DLMs) is reshaping the landscape of text generation and content creation. These models offer parallel generation capabilities, which can significantly increase throughput compared to traditional autoregressive models. Innovations in DLMs, such as dInfer and RemeDi, are making these models more practical for real-world applications, especially in areas requiring high-speed and high-quality output.\n\n**Representative projects**:\n- **dInfer**: Developed by Ant Group, this framework improves the inference speed of diffusion language models by up to 10 times, making them more viable for real-time applications.\n- **RemeDi**: This model, developed by the MAPLE Lab at West Lake University, introduces a \"remasking\" mechanism that allows for self-correction and improved text quality during the generation process.\n- **Veo 3.1**: Google's latest video generation model, Veo 3.1, expands on previous versions by incorporating audio and enhancing narrative control, showcasing the potential of diffusion-based models in multimedia applications.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**References** 🔗:\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-16-3\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-13-9\n- https://www.qbitai.com/2025/10/340924.html\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-12-5\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-14-14\n\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Human-Level Reasoning and Problem-Solving in Large Language Models**\n\nThe advancement of large language models (LLMs) in achieving human-level reasoning and problem-solving capabilities marks a significant milestone in AI research. Projects like GPT-5 Pro and the work by Alibaba on the Ring-1T model demonstrate the growing ability of LLMs to tackle complex scientific and mathematical problems, often outperforming human experts in certain domains. This trend is driven by improvements in reasoning frameworks and the integration of multiple modalities, enabling models to solve problems with greater accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Representative projects**:\n- **GPT-5 Pro**: Demonstrated the ability to solve complex physics problems, including a black hole theory challenge, in under 30 minutes, showcasing advanced reasoning capabilities.\n- **Ring-1T**: Developed by Ant Group, this trillion-parameter model exhibits strong reasoning abilities, with performance comparable to an IMO silver medalist in mathematical reasoning.\n- **OpenAI for Science**: This initiative focuses on developing AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery, with the hiring of physicist Alex Lupsasca to lead the effort.\n\n\n**References** 🔗:\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-15-5\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-12-2\n- https://www.qbitai.com/2025/10/340944.html\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-15-16\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-14-8\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-17-2\n- https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-10-12-7\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## B.
