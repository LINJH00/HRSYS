However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\underline{N}}on-simultan\\textbf{\\underline{e}}ous C\\textbf{\\underline{o}}ntinuous \\textbf{\\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Their success has been recently expanded to text generation via generating all tokens within a sequence concurrently. However, natural language exhibits a far more pronounced sequential dependency in comparison to images, and the majority of existing language models are trained with a left-to-right auto-regressive approach.To account for the inherent sequential characteristic of natural language, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion). AR-Diffusion ensures that the generation of tokens on the right depends on the generated ones on the left, a mechanism achieved through employing a dynamic number of denoising steps that vary based on token position. This results in tokens on the left undergoing fewer denoising steps than those on the right, thereby enabling them to generate earlier and subsequently influence the generation of tokens on the right.In a series of experiments on various text generation tasks, including text summarization, machine translation, and common sense generation, AR-Diffusion clearly demonstrated its superiority over existing diffusion language models and that it can be $100\\times\\sim600\\times$ faster when achieving comparable results.

While recent works have demonstrated successes on controlling simple sentence attributes (e.g., sentiment), there has been little progress on complex, fine-grained controls (e.g., syntactic structure). To address this challenge, we develop a new non-autoregressive language model based on continuous diffusions that we call Diffusion-LM. Building upon the recent successes of diffusion models in continuous domains, Diffusion-LM iteratively denoises a sequence of Gaussian vectors into word vectors, yielding a sequence of intermediate latent variables. The continuous, hierarchical nature of these intermediate variables enables a simple gradient-based algorithm to perform complex, controllable generation tasks. We demonstrate successful control of Diffusion-LM for six challenging fine-grained control tasks, significantly outperforming prior work.\nSupplementary Material: pdf\nCommunity Implementations: [![CatalyzeX](/images/catalyzex_icon.svg) 1 code implementation](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/diffusion-lm-improves-controllable-text/code)\n14 Replies\nLoading\n\nSOURCE: https://openreview.net/forum?id=3s9IrEsjLyk",

It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed the S2S-Diffusion model. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks. In this paper, we propose the Meta-Diffu$B$ framework—a novel scheduler-exploiter S2S-Diffusion paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of existing S2S-Diffusion models. We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-Diffu$B$ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets. We further investigate and visualize the impact of Meta-Diffu$B$'s noise scheduling on the generation of sentences with varying difficulties. Additionally, our scheduler model can function as a \"plug-and-play\" model to enhance DiffuSeq without the need for fine-tuning during the inference stage.\n\nSOURCE: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/91d193b65d0b120d29503590827de1ea-Abstract-Conference.html",

Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image, as synthesized text often contains blurred, unreadable, or incorrect characters, making visual text generation one of the most challenging issues in this field. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy. AnyText can write characters in multiple languages, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address multilingual visual text generation. It is worth mentioning that AnyText can be plugged into existing diffusion models from the community for rendering or editing text accurately. After conducting extensive evaluation experiments, our method has outperformed all other approaches by a significant margin. Additionally, we contribute the first large-scale multilingual text images dataset, AnyWord-3M, containing 3 million image-text pairs with OCR annotations in multiple languages. Based on AnyWord-3M dataset, we propose AnyText-benchmark for the evaluation of visual text generation accuracy and quality.

Given a caption, image generation requires fine-grained knowledge about attributes such as object structure, style, and viewpoint amongst others. Where does this information reside in text-to-image generative models? In our paper, we tackle this question and understand how knowledge corresponding to distinct visual attributes is stored in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. We adapt Causal Mediation Analysis for text-to-image models and trace knowledge about distinct visual attributes to various (causal) components in the (i) UNet and (ii) text-encoder of the diffusion model. In particular, we show that unlike large-language models, knowledge about different attributes is not localized in isolated components, but is instead distributed amongst a set of components in the conditional UNet. These sets of components are often distinct for different visual attributes (e.g., style} / objects). Remarkably, we find that the text-encoder in public text-to-image models such as Stable-Diffusion contains {\\it only} one causal state across different visual attributes, and this is the first self-attention layer corresponding to the last subject token of the attribute in the caption. This is in stark contrast to the causal states in other language models which are often the mid-MLP layers. Based on this observation of only one causal state in the text-encoder, we introduce a fast, data-free model editing method DiffQuickFix which can effectively edit concepts (remove or update knowledge) in text-to-image models. DiffQuickFix can edit (ablate) concepts in under a second with a closed-form update, providing a significant 1000x speedup and comparable editing performance to existing fine-tuning based editing methods.\n\nSOURCE: https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/poster/18667",

We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3 sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable advances in modern large language modeling (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wolf et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), showing impressive results in tasks such as expert-level coding (Roziere et al., 2023) and reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Trinh et al., 2024). Despite the considerable progress achieved, the left-to-right generative paradigm exhibits several long-standing drawbacks. For example, training and sampling of autoregressive models require a fixed ordering of the sequence, constraining their generation flexibility (Hoogeboom et al., 2022; Shih et al., 2022). Furthermore, at test time, the generation is heavily conditioned on previous generations, which leads to accumulated error a.k.a exposure bias (Bengio et al., 2015). As a result, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are actively being explored.\nDiscrete diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as a promising competitor for discrete sequence generation (Austin et al., 2021; Dieleman et al., 2022; Gat et al., 2024). Unlike AR models, discrete DMs conduct generation by progressively decoding the full sequence in parallel starting from a fully masked sequence, offering great potential in bidirectional controllable generation and sampling acceleration. Most recently, great efforts have been invested in improving their performance by extending discrete diffusions to operate in continuous time (Campbell et al., 2022; 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). Unfortunately, despite their promise, these models still underperform AR models by a large margin, resulting in limited practical usage. Developing principled and powerful discrete DMs remains an open problem.\nIn this work, we take a closer look at the existing discrete diffusion models and reveal a vital mismatch issue between the training and sampling distribution in its current form. Specifically, the existing discrete diffusion models aim to predict all missing tokens in parallel at each intermediate diffusion step, but the denoising joint distribution is simply parameterized as a product of token-wise independent distributions. As a result, intermediate denoising steps ignore sequence-level correlations, which results in serious accumulated decoding errors and prevents users from efficient parallel decoding with fewer timesteps. To this end, in this paper, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an unnormalized energy-based model (EBM) that learns to jointly denoise the full sequence at each diffusion step. Our key innovation is to learn an EBM for each denoising distribution , where the energy directly operates on the sequence level and captures the correlation between tokens. The fundamental challenge of our framework is to develop efficient training and sampling methods for the unnormalized model. To overcome these challenges, we design the EBM in a novel residual form\n| (1) |\napplied over pretrained diffusion models . Such formulation enjoys several distinct advantages. First, we analytically show that the EBM parameters can be easily obtained by leveraging pretrained autoregressive models or finetuning from bidirectional transformers via noise contrastive estimation, bypassing expensive maximum likelihood training. Furthermore, the framework corrects the decoding error and enables fast generation by conducting efficient important sampling in parallel over samples from the diffusion proposal distribution. Importantly, we highlight that, when leveraging pretraiend AR as the energy function, our approach can be interpreted as parallel sampling from pretrained language models using diffusion models as the proposal distribution.\nEDLM can be viewed as a new family of discrete generative models that marries energy-based and diffusion-based models. The novel combination addresses the training and sampling distribution mismatch problem, enjoys better generation quality with less accumulated error, and improves sampling efficiency by reducing the number of sampling steps. We further provide a formal estimator to calculate the perplexity of EDLM, allowing our model to be compared against other models in a standard way. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two common language modeling benchmarks to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Results show that on the perplexity metric, EDLM can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based counterparts, and approaches or matches AR models. On the generation quality metric, compared over the most competitive diffusion baseline, EDLM shows up to generative perplexity gain with the same number of sampling timesteps, and can achieve up to 1.3 sampling speedup when keeping the same sampling performance.\n2 Related Work\nDiffusion models are powerful models with surprising results in generating high-quality images (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). These models were originally designed for continuous data, with both forward and backward reverse processes parameterized as Gaussian Markov chains. In recent years, several methods have been developed to extend the diffusion framework to generate discrete data (Austin et al., 2021; Hoogeboom et al., 2022), with Campbell et al. (2022); Zhao et al. (2024) further extending the framework to model discrete data in continuous time. Most recently, several concurrent works (Lou et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024) archived impressive progress in large-scale language modeling by scaling the model and simplifying the training and sampling processes. Additionally, Campbell et al. (2024); Gat et al. (2024) developed flow matching methods for discrete data, which rely on a formulation similar to that of diffusion models. Despite the considerable progress in the area, we observe that all these approaches are subject to the training and sampling distribution mismatch issue, where the learned joint denoising distribution is simplified as independent distributions for each token. This problem results in a significant accumulated decoding error during the parallel sampling process and prevents users from conducting fast sampling with a small number of denoising timesteps. Deng et al. (2020) studies similar accumulated error problem (a.k.a exposure bias) in the autoregressive model setting and proposes energy-based models for modeling global context, but the methodology focuses on improving autoregressive models and therefore fundamentally different from ours. Other work (Gu et al., 2018; Ghazvininejad et al., 2019; Gu & Kong, 2021; Savinov et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023) study similar non-autoregressive text generation but combined with reranking and/or remasking methods. However, these methods typically result in biased sampling, which can generate high-quality samples but fail to model the distribution and suffer from low sampling diversity. Therefore, these methods mainly focus on different tasks such as machine translation. Notably, Lezama et al. (2023) notices a similar issue (focusing on diffusion models in the image generation domain) and proposes to learn a corrector network to correct the independent decoding error. However, this work concentrates on the image generation domain, and the correction process needs to be run sequentially, which takes additional inference time. In contrast, we propose an energy-based denoising process that directly captures the correlation at each denoising step and enables efficient parallel decoding via an importance sampling scheme.\n3 Discrete Diffusion Models\nGeneral Discrete Diffusion. Assume our data lives in a finite discrete space of size . In this paper, we augment the categorical space with an additional mask state with index . In a general discrete diffusion framework (Austin et al., 2021), the diffusion process is defined as a Markov chain , which repeatedly multiplies with matrices over discrete time steps. Given these transitions, the marginal distributions at each timestep can be written in closed-form as . Such forward process can also be viewed as an interpolation between a clean data sample and a reference distribution induced by :\n| (2) |\nwhere is a strictly decreasing function w.r.t , with and .\nIn the continuous time limit, for two arbitrary times , the transition distributions can be written as , where (Zhao et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). This implies that during each diffusion step the token will jump to a sample from the prior distribution with a probability of . The forward process allows us to compute many distributions in closed form. One particular distribution of interest is the reversal of the forward process given , that is, the posterior distribution given by\n| (3) |\nMasked Diffusion. In this paper, we focus on masked (i.e., absorbing state) diffusion models, where the target distribution is set as . At each diffusion step each token transitions to the ‘masked’ state with some probability. Under such masking framework, the forward marginals (eq. 2) are given by , and the posterior (eq. 3) can be simplified as\n| (4) |\nDiffusion models aim to learn a backward model to approximate the reversal of the forward process. Leveraging Equation 4 we can parameterize the model as\n| (5) |\nwhere is known as predictor, since it predicts the mean of the distribution over given . However, as explained next, the practical implementation of this predictor results in a mismatch between training and sampling distributions.\nProblem Statement. Existing discrete DMs learn a denoising distribution to match the true reversal . Let denote the tokens of a full sequence in this section. In practice, the model is parameterized as a factorized denoising model:\n| (6) |\nand the predictor factorizes each token in independently. This factorization enables us to conduct an efficient denoising step by first sampling all tokens from in parallel and then masking certain tokens according to the forward . However, this parameterization ignores dependencies between tokens in the sequence, a fundamental limitation which implies that can never match the exact backward . As a result, this parallel sampling introduces accumulated errors, as the factorized denoising step does not match the original generative model for the joint distribution of the elements of .\n4 Method\nIn this section, we formally introduce Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM). Our work aims to design a new family of energy-based discrete generative models that address the fundamental mismatch problem between and in existing models. We first describe the general EBM formulation in Section 4.1, and then elaborate on how to obtain the energy function by either leveraging pretrained AR models or finetuning via noise contrastive estimation in Section 4.2. Then we discuss how to estimate the likelihood (perplexity) of EDLM in Section 4.3, and finally introduce the efficient parallel sampling algorithm in Section 4.4\n4.1 Residual Energy-based Models\nDiscrete DMs can be viewed as learning a conditional predictor for each denoising step . For example, original discrete DMs learn to directly predict independent distributions for each token in . In our framework, given diffused data at timestep , we introduce the generative denoising kernel as an unnormalized density:\n| (7) |\nwhere is the pretrained diffusion model, is the energy introduced to capture the correlation in the sequence, and is a normalizing factor known as the partition function. In the following text, we use to denote the joint model, the (residual) energy function, and keep the pretrained fixed. Computing the partition function is intractable since it requires summing over the whole space, which is exponential in the sequence length. In our language modeling experiments, the vocabulary size is around k and the generation length is tokens, resulting in a space of size around . We aim to design solutions to efficiently train the parameters of the energy function so that the joint model distribution gets close to the true reversal , while avoiding computing the partition function.\n4.2 Implementation of Energy Function\nTraining energy-based models with the intractable partition function is a long-standing challenge in machine learning (Hinton, 2002; Carreira-Perpinan & Hinton, 2005; LeCun et al., 2006). Typical maximum likelihood estimation training requires approximation of the participation function using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which is computationally infeasible for high-dimensional data. We aim to find efficient ways to train the energy function’s parameters for the predictor . In the following, we describe two methods to do this. One involves taking pretrained autoregressive language models as energy functions without any training, and efficiently running sampling by taking all tokens as inputs in parallel. The second solution involves fine-tuning the pretrained diffusion model via noise contrastive estimation, where the model is parameterized with bidirectional transformers and potentially captures richer corre\n...[truncated]",

While cutting-edge\ndiffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised\nfine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume\nof data. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune\ndiffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images\n(“winner” and “loser” images) for each text prompt. In this paper, we introduce\nan innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-\nDiffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier\nversions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an\nalternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly\nimproving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-\na-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-\ntuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right\nfrom its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of\nRLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data.\nCodes are available at https://github.com/uclaml/SPIN-Diffusion/.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDiffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Peebles and Xie, 2023; Podell et al., 2023; Nichol et al., 2021;\nRombach et al., 2022a; Song et al., 2020a) have rapidly emerged as critical entities within the realm\nof generative AIs (Creswell et al., 2018; Kingma and Welling, 2013), demonstrating exceptional\ncapabilities in generating high-fidelity outputs. Their versatility spans a diverse area of applications,\nranging from image generation (Rombach et al., 2022a; Podell et al., 2023; Ramesh et al., 2022)\nto more complex tasks like structure-based drug design (Corso et al., 2022; Guan et al., 2023),\nprotein structure prediction (Watson et al., 2021), text generation (Austin et al., 2021; Zheng et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023), and more. Prominent diffusion models in image generation, including\nDALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2022), Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022b), SDXL (Podell et al., 2023),\nand Dreamlike, etc., typically undergo a fine-tuning process following their initial pre-training phase.\nStandard fine-tuning method for diffusion models suffers from low alignment with human preferences\nand low data efficiency due to two main reasons: (1) it does not directly optimize for alignment\nwith human preferences, and (2) only one round of training can be performed. Recently, using\nReinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning diffusion models has received increasing attention. Lee\net al. (2023) first studied the alignment of text-image diffusion models to human preferences using\nreward-weighted likelihood maximization with a reward function trained on human preference data.\n\n∗Equal contribution\n\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\n\n\fBlack et al. (2023) formulated the fine-tuning of diffusion models as a RL problem solved by policy\ngradient optimization. In a concurrent work, Fan et al. (2023) studied a similar formulation but with\na KL regularization. Very recently, Wallace et al. (2023) have bypassed the need for training reward\nfunctions by using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) for fine-tuning\ndiffusion models. Similar approach was proposed in Yang et al. (2023) as well.\nWhile RL fine-tuning of diffusion methods has been proven effective, its dependency on human\npreference data, often necessitating multiple images per prompt, poses a significant challenge. In\nmany datasets including the community-sourced ones featuring custom content, it is often the case to\nhave only one image associated with each prompt. This makes RL fine-tuning infeasible.\nIn this paper, drawing inspiration from the recently proposed self-play fine-tuning (SPIN) technique\n(Chen et al., 2024) for large language models (LLM), we introduce a new supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nmethod for diffusion models, eliminating the necessity for human preference data in the fine-tuning\nprocess. Central to our method is a general-sum minimax game, where both the participating players,\nnamely the main player and the opponent player, are diffusion models. The main player’s goal is to\ndiscern between samples drawn from the target data distribution and those generated by the opponent\nplayer. The opponent player’s goal is to garner the highest score possible, as assessed by the main\nplayer. A self-play mechanism can be made possible, if and only if the main player and the opponent\nplayer have the same structure, and therefore the opponent player can be designed to be previous\ncopies of the main player (Chen et al., 2024). The proposed algorithm SPIN-Diffusion overcomes\nthe drawbacks of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL fine-tuning. Compared with SFT, our\nmethod is more data-efficient, by repeatedly using the prompts from the SFT dataset to improve the\nmodel through self-play. Compared with RL fine-tuning methods, our method does not need external\nreward models or expensive human-annotated winner/loser pairs.\nWhen applying the self-play fine-tuning technique (Chen et al., 2024) to diffusion models, there\nare two challenges: (a) an exponential or even infinite number of possible trajectories can lead to\nthe same image. The generator in a diffusion model operates through a sequence of intermediate\nsteps, but the performance of the generator is only determined by the quality of the image in the\nlast step; and (b) diffusion models are parameterized by a sequence of score functions, which are\nthe gradient of the probabilities rather than probabilities in LLMs. Our algorithm design effectively\nsurmounts these challenges by (a) designing an objective function that considers all intermediate\nimages generated during the reverse sampling process; and (b) decomposing and approximating\nthe probability function step-by-step into products related to the score function. We also employ\nthe Gaussian reparameterization technique in DDIM (Song et al., 2020a) to support the advanced\nsampling method. All these techniques together lead to an unbiased objective function that can\nbe effectively calculated based on intermediate samples. For computational efficiency, we further\npropose an approximate objective function, which eliminates the need for intermediate images used\nin our model.\nContributions. Our contributions are summarized below:\n\n• We propose a novel fine-tuning method for diffusion models based on the self-play mechanism,\ncalled SPIN-Diffusion. The proposed algorithm iteratively improves upon a diffusion model\nuntil converging to the target distribution. Theoretically, we prove that the model obtained by\nSPIN-Diffusion cannot be further improved via standard SFT. Moreover, the stationary point of our\nself-play mechanism is achieved when the diffusion model aligns with the target distribution.\n\n• Empirically, we evaluate the performance of SPIN-Diffusion on text-to-image generation\ntasks (Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022a; Saharia et al., 2022a). Our experiments\non the Pick-a-Pic dataset (Kirstain et al., 2023), with base model being Stable Diffusion-1.5 (Rom-\nbach et al., 2022b), demonstrate that SPIN-Diffusion surpasses SFT from the very first iteration.\nNotably, by the second iteration, SPIN-Diffusion outperforms Diffusion-DPO (Wallace et al., 2023)\nthat utilizes additional data from ‘loser’ samples. By the third iteration, the images produced by\nSPIN-Diffusion achieve a higher PickScore (Kirstain et al., 2023) than the base model SD-1.5\n79.8% of the times, and a superior Aesthetic score 88.4% of the times.\n\nSPIN-Diffusion exhibits a remarkable performance improvement over current state-of-the-art fine-\ntuning algorithms, retaining this advantage even against models trained with more extensive data\nusage. This highlights its exceptional efficiency in dataset utilization. It is beneficial for the general\npublic, particularly those with restricted access to datasets containing multiple images per prompt.\n\n2\n\n\fNotation. We use lowercase letters and lowercase boldface letters to denote scalars and vectors,\nrespectively. We use 0 : T to denote the index set {0, . . . , T }. In the function space, let F be\nthe function class. We use the symbol q to denote the real distribution in a diffusion process,\nwhile pθ represents the distribution parameterized by a nueral network during sampling. The\nGaussian distribution is represented as N (µ, Σ), where µ and Σ are the mean and covariance matrix,\nrespectively. Lastly, Uniform{1, . . . , T } denotes the uniform distribution over the set {1, . . . , T }.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nDiffusion Models. Diffusion-based generative models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) have recently\ngained prominence, attributed to their ability to produce high-quality and diverse samples. A popular\ndiffusion model is denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020). Song et al.\n(2020a) proposed a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which extended DDPM to a non-\nMarkov diffusion process, enabling a deterministic sampling process and the accelerated generation\nof high-quality samples. In addition to DDPM and DDIM, diffusion models have also been studied\nwith a score-matching probabilistic model using Langevin dynamics (Song and Ermon, 2019; Song\net al., 2020b). Diffusion models evolved to encompass guided diffusion models, which are designed\nto generate conditional distributions. When the conditioning input is text and the output is image,\nthese models transform into text-to-image diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022a; Ramesh et al.,\n2022; Ho et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b). They bridge the gap between textual descriptions and\nimage synthesis, offering exciting possibilities for content generation. A significant advancement in\ntext-to-image generation is the introduction of Stable Diffusion (SD) (Rombach et al., 2022a). SD\nhas expanded the potential of diffusion models by integrating latent variables into the generation\nprocess. This innovation in latent diffusion models enables the exploration of latent spaces and\nimproves the diversity of generated content. Despite the introduction of latent spaces, generating\nimages with desired content from text prompts remains a significant challenge (Gal et al., 2022; Ruiz\net al., 2023). This is due to the difficulty in learning the semantic properties of text prompts with\nlimited high-quality data.\nFine-Tuning Diffusion Models. Efforts to improve diffusion models have focused on aligning\nthem more closely with human preferences. Rombach et al. (2022a) fine-tuned a pre-trained model\nusing the COCO dataset (Caesar et al., 2018), demonstrating superior performance compared to a\ngenerative model directly trained on the same dataset. Podell et al. (2023) expanded the model size\nof Stable Diffusion (SD) to create the SDXL model, which was fine-tuned on a high-quality but\nprivate dataset, leading to a significant improvement in the aesthetics of the generated images. Dai\net al. (2023) further demonstrated the effectiveness of fine-tuning and highlighted the importance\nof the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. In addition to using datasets with high-quality images,\nBetker et al. (2023); Segalis et al. (2023) found that SFT on a data set with high text fidelity can\nalso improve the performance of the diffusion model. The aforementioned methods only requires\na high-quality SFT dataset. Recently, preference datasets have been studied in finetuing diffusion\nmodels (Lee et al., 2023). Concurrently, DDPO (Black et al., 2023) and DPOK (Fan et al., 2023)\nproposed to use the preference dataset to train a reward model and then fine-tune diffusion models\nusing reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from the recent Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), Diffusion-DPO (Wallace et al., 2023) and D3PO (Yang et al., 2023)\nused the implicit reward to fine-tune diffusion models directly on the preference dataset. Furthermore,\nwhen a differentiable reward model is available, Clark et al. (2023); Prabhudesai et al. (2023) applied\nreward backpropagation for fine-tuning diffusion models. Our SPIN-Diffusion is most related to the\nSFT method, as it only assumes access to high-quality image-text pairs. However, the high-quality\nimage-text dataset can be obtained from various sources, including selecting the winner from a\npreference dataset or identifying high-reward image-text pairs through a reward model.\n\n3 Problem Setting and Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we introduce basic settings for text-to-image generation by diffusion models and the\nself-play fine-tuning (SPIN) method.\n\n3.1 Text-to-Image Diffusion Model\n\nDenoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) (Song et al., 2020a) is a generalized framework of\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020).\nDDIM enables the fast generation of high-quality samples and has been widely used in text-to-image\n\n3\n\n\fdiffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022a). We formulate our method building\nupon DDIM, which makes it more general.\nForwrd Process. Following Saharia et al. (2022b), the problem of text-to-image generation can be\nformulated as conditional diffusion models. We use x0 ∈ Rd to denote the value of image pixels\nwhere d is the dimension and use c to denote the text prompt. Given a prompt c, image x0 is drawn\nfrom a target data distribution pdata(·|c). The diffusion process is characterized by the following\ndynamic parameterized by a positive decreasing sequence {αt}T\n\nt=1 with α0 = 1,\n\nq(x1:T |x0) := q(xT |x0)\n\nT\n(cid:89)\n\nt=2\n\nq(xt−1|xt, x0),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere q(xt−1|xt, x0) represents a Gaussian distribution N (µt, σ2\nt I). Here, µt is the mean of\nGaussian defined as\n√\n\n√\n\n(cid:113)\n\nµt :=\n\nαt−1x0 +\n\n1 − αt−1 − σ2\nt ·\n\nxt −\n√\n\nαtx0\n\n.\n\n1 − αt\n\n√\n\nIt can be derived from (3.1) that q(xt|x0) = N (\nαtx0, (1 − αt)I) for all t (Song et al., 2020a). As\na generalized diffusion process of DDPM, (3.1) reduces to DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) with a special\nchoice of σt = (cid:112)(1 − αt−1)/(1 − αt)(cid:112)(1 − αt/αt−1).\nGenerative Process\n...[truncated]"

Furthermore, compared to autoregressive mdoels, SEDD generates faithful text without requiring distribution annealing techniques like temperature scaling (around $6$-$8\\times$ better generative perplexity than un-annealed GPT-2), can trade compute and quality (similar quality with $32\\times$ fewer network evaluations), and enables controllable infilling (matching nucleus sampling quality while enabling other strategies besides left to right prompting).",

Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that iDreamRec not only outperforms existing diffusion-based generative recommenders but also facilitates the incorporation of intention instructions for more precise and effective recommendation generation.",
